    <ol>
        <li>
            Heat oil over high in a large deep skillet or wok. Add onions and cook until lightly browned and softened, about 2 minutes. Add hot dogs and cook, stirring constantly until browned. Add in rice and sesame oil and cook, stirring constantly, about 1 minute. Stir in ginger, garlic, salt and pepper.

            Spread mixture into an even layer and cook, undisturbed, until rice is lightly toasted, about 2 minutes. Add in mixed vegetables and stir, then cook undisturbed for 2 minutes. Push rice mixture to the sides and create a space in the center of the skillet. Add butter to the skillet and allow to melt. Crack in eggs and cook, stirring only the eggs until they are soft scrambled. Fold eggs into rice mixture and stir until evenly mixed. Stir in vinegar and soy sauce and cook for 1 minute. Remove from heat.

            Combine mayo, Sriracha and lemon juice in a small bowl. Serve fried rice topped with a drizzle of mayo mixture and sprinkle with green onions.
